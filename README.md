series of simple puzzle games built using o1js on Mina

i will be building puzzle games as i learn about and experiment with various features of o1js and Mina

### below are a few games on my list to be built
- where is waldo? where is mina?
- paper-scissor-stone (P2P, private commits and reveal at the same time)
- tic-tac-toe (P2P recursive)
- magic squares
- sudoku

### concepts to be explored and implemented
- composability (i.e: shared leaderboard across puzzles)
- inclusion proof (i.e: 1 of many possible answer)
- p2p play using recursion and websocket/webRTC
- etc
